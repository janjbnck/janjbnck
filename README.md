# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Jan, I'm 17 years old, and I live in Hamburg, Germany. Iâ€™m interested in **computer science**, particularly **web development**, which Iâ€™ve been mostly teaching myself over the past few years. Iâ€™ve already completed 2 student internships in the IT field and will start my **apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development** at the [Fricke Group](https://fricke.de) in August. I come from Poland, so I also speak Polish fluently in addition to German and English. Besides my IT activities, Iâ€™m a member of a shooting club and go on long-distance bike rides.
